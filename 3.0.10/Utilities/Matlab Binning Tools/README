ESME Workbench 2012 - MATLAB log file interface

The MATLAB log file interface has three primary functions that offer 
different levels of granularity for data access.

1.  logread : this function, given the path to a simulation log, returns a 
    struct containing ALL the data present in a given simulation *.log
    file. Since this data is cached in memory, this may not be an option 
    for very large simulations.

For long simulations, or fine-grained access, two other functions are
provided: 

2.  readLogFileHeader: given the path to a simulation log, this returns a 
    small struct containing the metadata present in the log file.  Most 
    importantly, this includes: a list of byte offset addresses for the
    results of the simulation at each time step; a list of ID keys for each
    platform, mode, and animat in the simulation; and the duration and size
    of each simulation time step. 

using (2), individual time step results can be accessed with fread() and 

3.  readTimeStepRecord: given a file handle and a byte offset obtained from
    (2), this returns a struct containing a given time step's time, the 
    position of every platform and animat in the scenario at that time
    step, and a list of all animats that were exposed to sound at that time
    step along with the ID of the mode that exposed them, the sound level, 
    and the total energy accumulated at that time step.

From these three functions, a complete reconstruction of the simulation may
be made, and any number of types of post-processing may be performed. 

For demonstration and basic purposes, PlotSpeciesModeHistograms.m performs
one example of this.  Operating on a .xml file generated simultaneously
with the simulation log, it plots a histogram of sound exposures for each
species, binned into ten 10 dB bins and separated by contributing mode.
