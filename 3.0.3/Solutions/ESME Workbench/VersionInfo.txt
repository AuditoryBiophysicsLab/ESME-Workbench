// This file must contain a line that will be used as a version number by many assemblies in this project
// There should only be one non-blank, non-commented line, and that line should have three positive integers 
// separated by periods, like this:
//
// 1.2.3
//
// This number will have the subversion version number of the directory appended to it, and it will be written
// to various locations by the ProjectBuildInfo tool.
//
// One of the files output will typically be called AssemblyVersionInfo.cs and will look something like this, 
// where 4567 is the subversion version number for this example
//
// using System.Reflection;
// [assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.2.3.4567")]
// [assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("1.2.3.4567")] 
//
// Another file is generated by ProjectBuildInfo, and is used for versioning the installers when they are built.
// This file is typically named version.wxi and will look something like this:
//
// <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
// <Include>
//   <?define ProductFullVersion = "2.9.4.3205" ?>
// </Include>
//
// version.wxi is included by the installer WiX files that need it. At the time of this writing, that's the 
// ESME Workbench installer (the one that installs the app, not the fancy graphical bootstrapper), as well as
// the ESME Bootstrap Installer (the installer that runs under the auspices of the fancy bootstrapper, and
// installs ESME Workbench along with the installable NAVO databases and the plugin that lets ESME access those
// databases

// Here's the version number at last!  Remember, should look something like 1.2.3 (three positive integers separated by
// periods).  OK?
