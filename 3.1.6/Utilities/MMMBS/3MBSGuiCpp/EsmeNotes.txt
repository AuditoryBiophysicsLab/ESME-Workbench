Setup instructions:
Note: I'd rather use registry entries, but can't find indication of Matlab support.

Note: On my computer, I've set the install directory to MarineMammalMovementSimulator

The following requires install Sheild installation program.
1. Add 3MBS exe executable location to environmental path variable.
2. Set "MMMB_PATH" environmental vars with 3mbs exe location
3. Set up a separate registry entry for INPUT.
	* Environmental Data Bathymetry
	* Environmental Data Salinity
	* Environmental Data Temperature
	* Species
	* Scenarios.
  Note 1: The individual registry entry is updated each time a data file of it's
          type is accessed.
  Note 2: All folders are initially within the same super folder... i.e
		  ..\mmmbs\mmmbs.exe
		  ..\mmmbs\environmentalData\*.bth
		  ..\mmmbs\environmentalData\*.slt
		  ..\mmmbs\environmentalData\*.tem
		  ..\mmmbs\species\*.spe
		  ..\mmmbs\scenarios\*.sce
  Note 3: Code will have to check if the folder exists.  If not, goes to default folder.

4. Use "MMMB_PATH" for 3MBS OUTPUT.
  Note1: 3MBS output always goes into ..\mmmbs\ouput\ folder, but creates new sub folder
         for each run.
	* Binary output
	* Text output
	* Logs
  Note2: Has following format:
		..\mmmbs\ouput\YYYY_MM_DD_HH_MM_SS\*.bin
		..\mmmbs\ouput\YYYY_MM_DD_HH_MM_SS\*.txt (animat text output)
		..\mmmbs\ouput\YYYY_MM_DD_HH_MM_SS\*.txt (various logs).


ESME:
 * Must explcitly tell 3MBS file and paths to use for both input.
 * Output is optional since ESME has no dependancy upon it. If output options set
   to TRUE, a directory must be specified.  If none specified, 3MBS will output to
   it's default home directory "MMMB_PATH".  Since I can't force ESME to use
   environmental variables inside the scripts I'll just create a directory and
   hardcode it in the scripts for now.  The directory will be:
   "D:\MarineMammalMovementSimulator\ESME_IO"
	* Data Output.
	* Data Input
	* Logs





BUG / FIXES list in ESME
------------------------
(1) ESME doesn't pass the full path of data files (bathymetry) to 3MBS, so I've
    hardcoded the path.  This needs to be corrected!!!!

(2) Lat/Lon backwards in GUI menu 'Mammal Movement'-> 'Center of Mammal Distribution'.

(3) Why is there an option to set a duration in 'Mammal Movement' -> 'Duration of Simulation'?
    Simulation duration is determined by how long the ships run.

(4) Remove all the "you may proceed" dialog boxes.

Test extreme cases:
1-to-1
1-to-all
off-number (12, 13, ...)


Have ESME create (by date) and pass directories to 3MBS to use. 
3MBS uses defaults otherwise
Have ESME pass logging options to 3MBS including passed params files, data recieved,
etc...

ESME needs to have animal depths put to a positive number?
Improve error reporting to and from ESME/3MBS.
