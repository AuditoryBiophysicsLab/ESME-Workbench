# The ESME Workbench. 

The goal of the Effects of Sound on the Marine Environment(ESME) research program is to create novel modeling and simulation tools to aid in understanding the potential environmental impacts of manmade underwater sound in general, and more specifically the impacts of Naval training exercises. The Workbench combines models of sound sources and propagation with biological models developed by basic research scientists at multiple laboratories into a single framework.

The ESME Workbench software has the important distinction of being open and peer-reviewed which allows the research community as well as the Navy to be completely aware of the details behind the simulations. In addition, the user interface for these tools is being carefully designed for ease-of-use for the non-expert without sacrificing the capability to model complex scenarios.
