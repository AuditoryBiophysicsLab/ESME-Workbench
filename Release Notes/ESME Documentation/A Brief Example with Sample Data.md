# A Brief Example with Sample Data
The configuration wizard has created a collection of pre-computed examples for browsing and exploration.  To get a feel for how ESME works, let’s open a location and its associated scenario, and then visualize the sound propagation at a particular location in that part of the ocean.

##### Opening a Location

First, locate the Southern California item in the Locations pane located on the lower left hand side of the application window. Right-click on “Southern California” and select “Zoom to Location”.  This will re-center the map display to the southern coast, and zoom in to the boundary of the location.  The checkbox next to each location toggles the display of its boundary on the map.
