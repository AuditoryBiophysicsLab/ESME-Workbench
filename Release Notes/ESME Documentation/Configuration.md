# Configuration

## Getting Started
Having successfully installed the ESME Workbench and all associated Environmental Databases, navigate to the ESME Workbench icon in the Start Menu, and launch ESME.

The first time ESME runs, a wizard will run to help you configure some default locations.  Select “Yes”.    A progress window will display over the main UI:

This will create three sample locations, each with one high frequency acoustic source, one low frequency source, one sample mammal population, and four types of environmental data, at various interesting locations along the coastal United States.  Each of these locations, in turn, contains sound propagations to visualize.

** Some users, for whom disc space is at a premium, may opt not to create the sample locations.  The total size on disk of three sample scenarios is approximately 2-3 GB. **

Once up and running, more locations, scenarios, and sound sources can be created and interacted with.
