# Installation
The latest stable version of ESME can be installed from the project website <a href="https://esme.bu.edu/download">here</a>.

The latest development version is available <a href="https://esme.bu.edu/development">here</a>.  **Please note**: the development version of the ESME Workbench contains new features and is likely to be more unstable. Installers found on this page are updated frequently and without warning.

The installer will install the Workbench and a default set of environmental databases. Installed size is approximately 1.8GB.

### Upgrading from a previous version of ESME

If you have installed a previous version of ESME, it is not typically necessary to reinstall the Environmental Databases.  Both release and development versions of ESME are available as just the Workbench, which requires significantly less time to install.
