# Effects of Sound on the Marine Environment: Quick Start Guide

## 25 April 2014


ESME is an ONR Life Sciences Research Program focused on producing an integrated computer model of animal response to the sound fields produced by human activities, with a special emphasis on naval sound sources such as sonars, explosives, and acoustic communications.

This is the Quick-Start Guide for the current release of ESME Workbench 2014.

ESME allows you to:
* Create, edit, and explore ocean environments across the globe
* Visualize and analyze the transmission of sound underwater with two different sound propagation algorithms.
* Create, position, and move narrow-band sound sources and simulate their effects on moving model marine mammals that are in range.
* Generate and view exposure histograms and optionally analyze them further with an API available in either MATLAB or Python

*ESME Workbench runs on Windows, and has been tested on XP, Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8. *
