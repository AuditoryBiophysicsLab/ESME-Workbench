Using the slider near the bottom of the transmission loss viewer, scroll through each directional slices in the analysis point.  Click and drag on the color bar to adjust the displayed scale.

From here, the displayed transmission loss radial can be saved to disc as an image or CSV file.

By default, the color bar scale is relative to the minimum and maximum value of the *entire* transmission loss at that analysis point.

Double-click to reset the scale to be relative to the current radial of that transmission lossâ€™ values.
