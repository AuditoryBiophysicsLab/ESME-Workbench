# Viewing Marine Mammal Populations
The configuration wizard has added an example marine mammal population to each scenario.  In the Scenario tab, expand the Species tree, and check the species to display it on the map.

ESME uses the [Marine Mammal Movement and Behavior (3MB)](http://nmmf.org/the-marine-mammal-movement-and-behavior-3mb-software-package/) program for the creation and simulation of animal movement and behavior within the ocean. The program permits a bounded stochastic simulation of individual animals, or animats, through defined behavioral states.

For this version of ESME, animals are seeded throughout the simulation area with a uniform, user-specified population density specified in average number of animals per square kilometer.  The default value is 0.01.

Species can be repopulated, or their properties changed, via a context menu.

Each species has predefined behaviors and modeling constraints that 3MB uses for animal movement, placement, diving profile behavior, podding behavior, and more.

Twenty-one marine mammal species are currently supported.
