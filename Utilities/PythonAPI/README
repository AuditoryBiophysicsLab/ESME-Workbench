ESME Workbench 2012 - Python log file interface

This is the python API for accessing the simulation.exposures file generated by The ESME Workbench (http://esme.bu.edu).  It has been tested on Python 2.6 and Python 2.7.
This API uses language features not provided by Python <= 2.5, and will not work on those versions.  Please update!

The latest version of this API, and the workbench, can be found at http://esme.bu.edu/download .

The pysim module provides the class PySim.   Constructing a new instance of the class with the filename of the simulation.exposures file reads the header of that file and
populates class attributes appropriately via an internal method.

ex:

    from pysim import PySim
    sim = PySim("""/path/to/simulation.exposures""") #  replace with your path

sim will now contain non-null header information, including sim.TimeStepRecordOffsets -- a list of indicies of each time step record.

sim.ReadTimeStepRecord(offset)  returns a struct containing a given time step's time, the
    position of every platform and animat in the scenario at that time
    step, and a list of all animats that were exposed to sound at that time
    step along with the ID of the mode that exposed them, the sound level,
    and the total energy accumulated at that time step.

ex:

    recordFirst = sim.ReadTimeStepRecord(sim.TimeStepRecordOffsets[0])
    recordLast = sim.ReadTimeStepRecord(sim.TimeStepRecordOffsets[-1])
    print "the first record had {0} actors and began at {1}".format(recordFirst.ActorCount, recordFirst.StartTime)
    print "the last record had {0} actors and began at {1}".format(recordLast.ActorCount, recordLast.StartTime)
