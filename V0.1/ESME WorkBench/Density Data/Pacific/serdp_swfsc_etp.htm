  <meta name="dc.description" content="vWe use data from 16 ship-based cetacean and ecosystem assessment surveys to develop habitat models to predict density for 15 cetacean species in the ETP and for 12 cetacean species in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE). All data were collected by NOAA&rsquo;s Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) from 1986-2006 using accepted, peer-reviewed survey methods. Data include over 17,000 sightings of cetacean groups on transects covering over 400,000 km. The expected number of groups seen per transect segment and the expected size of groups were modeled separately as functions of habitat variables. Model predictions were then used in standard line-transect formulae to estimate density for each transect segment for each survey year. Predicted densities for each year were smoothed with geospatial methods to obtain a continuous grid of density estimates for the surveyed area. These annual grids were then averaged to obtain a composite grid that represents our best estimates of cetacean density over the past 20 years in the ETP and the past 15 years in the CCE. Many methodological choices were required for every aspect of this modeling. In completing this project, we explored as many of these choices as possible and used the choices that resulted in the best predictive models. To evaluate predictive power, we used cross-validation (leaving out one survey year and predicting densities for that year with models built using only the other years). Data from the two most recent surveys (2005 in the CCE and 2006 in the ETP) were used for this model validation step. We explored three modeling approaches to predict cetacean densities from habitat variables: Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) with polynomials, Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with nonparametric smoothing functions, and Regression Trees. Within the category of GAMs, we tested and compared several software implementations. In summary, we found that Regression Trees could not deal effectively with the large number of transect segments containing zero sightings. GLMs and GAMs both performed well and differences between the models built using these methods were typically small. Different GAM implementations also gave similar, but not identical results. We chose the GAM framework to build our best-and-final models. In some cases, only the linear terms were selected, making them equivalent to GLMs. We explored the effects of two aspects of sampling scale (resolution and extent) on our cetacean density models. To explore the effect of resolution, we sampled transect segments on scales ranging from 2 to 120 km. We found that differences in segment lengths within this range had virtually no effect on our models in the ETP, but that scale affected the models for some species in the CCE where habitats are more geographically variable. For our best-and-final models, we accommodated this regional scale difference by using a longer segment length in the ETP (10 km) than in the CCE (5 km). To explore the effect of extent, we constructed models using data from the ETP and CCE separately and for the two ecosystems combined. We found that the best predictive models were based on data from only one ecosystem; therefore, all our best-and-final models are specific to either the CCE or the ETP. We explored five methods of interpolating oceanographic measurements to obtain continuous grids of our in situ oceanographic habitat variables. Cross-validation of the interpolations gave similar results for all methods. Ordinary kriging was chosen as our preferred method because it is widely used and because, qualitatively, it did not produce unrealistic &ldquo;bull&rsquo;s eyes&rdquo; in the continuous grids. We explored the use of CCE oceanographic habitat data from two available sources: in situ measurements collected during cetacean surveys and remotely sensed measurements from satellites. Only sea surface temperature (SST) and measures of its variance were available from remotely sensed sources, whereas the in situ measurements also included sea surface salinity, surface chlorophyll and vertical properties of the water-column. We conducted a comparison of the predictive ability of models built using in situ, remotely sensed, or combined data and found that the combined models typically resulted in the best density predictions for a novel year of data. In our best-and-final CCE models we therefore used the combination of in situ and remotely sensed data that gave the best predictive power. In some years, in situ data also included net tows and acoustic backscatter. We explored whether indices of &ldquo;mid-trophic&rdquo; species abundance derived from these sources improved the predictive power of our models. The plankton and small nekton (mid-trophic level species) sampled by these methods are likely to include cetacean prey and were therefore expected to be closely correlated with cetacean abundance. We tested the predictive power of models built with 1) only physical oceanographic and chlorophyll data, 2) only net-tow indices, 3) only acoustic backscatter indices, or 4) the optimal combination of all three in situ data sources. We found that models for some species were improved by using mid-trophic measures of their habitat, but the improvement was marginal in most cases. Although the results look promising, our best-and-final models do not include indices of mid-trophic species abundance because acoustic backscatter was measured on too few surveys. We explored the effect of seasonality on our models using aerial survey data collected in February and March of 1991 and 1992. Due to logistic constraints, our ship survey data are limited to summer and fall seasons, corresponding to the &ldquo;warm-season&rdquo; for cetaceans in the CCE. Although some data in winter and spring (the &ldquo;cold-season&rdquo;) are available from aerial surveys in California, these data are too sparse to develop habitat models. We therefore tested whether models built from data collected during multiple warm seasons could be use to predict density patterns in the cold season. We used the 1991-92 aerial surveys to test these predictions. Although the warm-season models were able to predict cold-season density patterns for some species, they could not do so reliably, because some of the cold-season habitat variables were outside the range of values used to build the models. Furthermore, the two available years of cold-season data did not include a full range of inter-annual variation in winter oceanographic conditions. An additional complication is that some cetaceans found in the CCE during the warm season are migratory and nearly absent in the cold season. For these reasons, our best-and-final models based on warm-season data in the CCE should not be used to predict cetacean densities for the cold season. Our best-and-final models for the CCE and the ETP have been incorporated into a web-based GIS software system developed by Duke University&rsquo;s SERDP Team in close collaboration with our SWFSC SERDP Team. The web site (http://serdp.env.duke.edu/) is currently hosted at Duke University but needs to be transitioned to a permanent home. The software, called the Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS), allows the user to view our model outputs as color-coded maps of cetacean density as well as maps that depict the precision of the models (expressed as point-wise standard errors and log-normal 90% confidence intervals). The user can pan and zoom to their area of interest. To obtain quantitative information about cetacean densities, including the coefficients of variation, the user can define a specific operational area either by 1) choosing one from a pull-down menu, 2) uploading a shape file defining that area, or 3) interactively choosing perimeter points. Density estimates for a user-selected area are produced along with estimates of their uncertainty. Although our models include most of the species found in the CCE and the ETP, sample sizes were too small to model density for rarely seen species. Additionally, we could not develop models for the cold season in the CCE or for areas around the Hawaiian Islands due to data limitations. To provide the best available density estimates for these data-limited cases, we have included stratified estimates of density from traditional line-transect analyses in the SDSS where available: cold-season estimates from aerial surveys off California, estimates from ship surveys in the US EEZ around Hawaii, and estimates for rarely seen species found in the CCE and the ETP.

<dt><em>Purpose:</em>  
<dd>

The Navy and other users of the marine environment conduct many activities that can potentially harm marine mammals. Consequently, these entities are required to complete Environmental Assessments and Environmental Impact Statements to determine the likely impact of their activities. Specifically, those documents require an estimate of the number of animals that might be harmed or disturbed. A key element of this estimation is knowledge of cetacean (whale, dolphin, and porpoise) densities in specific areas where those activities will occur.
<br/>
Cetacean densities are typically estimated by line-transect surveys. Within United States Exclusive Economic Zone (US EEZ) waters and in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP), most cetacean surveys have been conducted by the US National Marine Fisheries Service as part of their stock assessment research and typically result in estimates of cetacean densities in very large geographic strata (e.g., the entire US West Coast). Although estimates are sometimes available for smaller strata (e.g., the waters off southern California), these areas are still much larger than the operational areas where impacts may occur (e.g., the Navy&rsquo;s Southern California Offshore Range (SCORE) off San Clemente Island). Stratification methods cannot provide accurate density estimates for small areas because sample size (i.e., the number of cetacean sightings) becomes limiting as areas become smaller. Recently, habitat modeling has been developed as a method to estimate cetacean densities. These models allow predictions of cetacean densities on a finer spatial scale than traditional line-transect analyses because cetacean densities are estimated as a continuous function of habitat variables (i.e., sea surface temperature, seafloor depth, distance from shore, prey density, etc.). Cetacean densities can then be predicted wherever these habitat variables can be measured or estimated, within the area that was modeled.
<br/>
The transition of our research to operational use by the Navy was facilitated throughout our project through a series of workshops conducted with potential Navy users. These workshops ensured that the SDSS would meet Navy user needs. The on-line SDSS web site will ensure continued availability of the density estimates from our models and will be available for use by Navy planners within a month of the completion of this report. The SDSS will, however, be just the first step in the transition to general usage. Although Duke University is willing to host the web site in the short term, a permanent site is needed with base-funded, long-term support. Because the models and software have utility to a much greater user community than just the Navy or other branches of the military, the software might be best maintained by NOAA. In addition to maintenance of the web site, the models themselves need to be maintained to incorporate new survey data. Furthermore, there is a need to expand the models to include more areas (e.g., Hawaii), different seasons (e.g., the cold-season in the CCE), migration patterns (e.g., baleen whales), and additional species (e.g., pinnipeds). Recent advances in processing and integrating remotely sensed data, ocean circulation models, buoy data, ship reports, and animal tagging data may offer new approaches to improving models in the future. There is also a need to obtain buy-in from the regulatory agencies (primarily NOAA) for the use of these models as the &ldquo;best available&rdquo; estimates of cetacean density in environmental compliance documents. This buy-in can best be achieved by educating the staff in NOAA Headquarters and Regional Offices on the use of, and scientific justification for, model-based estimates. The maintenance and improvement of our SDSS for cetaceans might be best achieved by a long-term partnership between Navy and NOAA.

Since fieldnames of shapefiles are limited to 10 characters, the following name scheme was used:
<br/>
  species_model_season_output
<br/>
species:
  Bed = Bryde whales (Balaenoptera edeni)
  Bmu = blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus)
  Dde = short-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus delphis)
  Ggr = Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus)
  Gsp = Guild: pilot whales (Globicephala)
  Ksp = Guild: Kogia (Kogia)
  Msp = Guild: Mesoplodon species (Mesoplodon)
  Oor = killer whale (Orcinus orca)
  Pma = sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus)
  Sat = offshore spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata)
  Sat = coastal spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata graffmani)
  Sbr = rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis)
  Sco = striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba)
  Sli = eastern spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris orientalis) 
  Slo = whitebelly spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris)
  Ttr = bottlenose dolphin (Turisops truncatus)
  Zca = Guild: Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris)
  Zsm = Guild: small beaked whale (Ziphius and Mesoplodon)
<br/>
model type:
  s = simple
  c = complex
For every guild, a bunch of different gam models were built using mgcv with various settings for gam.method, cs or ts splines, and gamma=1.0 or 1.4.  Roughly 10 different encounter rate models and 6 different group size models for each guild were built using the exact same sighting and environmental data.  The differences in the # of degrees of freedom that mgcv incorporated into each of the final models for any given guild were striking: it was common for one set of model-building parameters to settle upon a model with 60 edf, whereas another would select only 12.  I looked at a variety of model evaluation statistics and plotted predictions for the &quot;best&quot; model with tons of degrees of freedom, then I compared the different criteria to those for the &quot;best&quot; model with very few degrees of freedom.  The feedback that we received from the cetacean experts at our internal SWFSC workshop was that they liked the geographic plots of the predictions from the simple models best, so those are what I went with in most cases.  The Ziphius model has &quot;complx&quot; in the title, but that's kind of misleading.  It was really built from the simple ER and GS models, but I used a tensor product spline to incorporate an interaction between sst and salinity, which helped the predictive ability of the models.
